# peer-chat
Peer-to-Peer based messaging application for my final year project.

The intention of this project is to provide a private and trusted service for small groups of friends or family to communicate while maintaining all control over data and privacy.
Will use centralised device for login/authentication of users, hosted privately at home on a linux based device such as a Raspberry Pi.
